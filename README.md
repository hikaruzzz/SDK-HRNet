# SDK-HRNet

## Source code of paper "High-resolution convolutional neural networks for point clouds with space decomposition kernel"

### A method for point clouds semantic segmentation and classification task with a novel point-wise convolution.

### Contribution
* SDK-Conv. A space decomposition kernel based convolution can directly process 3D point clouds effective and maintains the translation-invariance as in regular convolution.
* SDK-HRNet. A deep neural network built with SDKConv as the convolution and modified modules to achieve efficient 3D point clouds classification and semantic segmentation.

### Code review
* Not public currently.
